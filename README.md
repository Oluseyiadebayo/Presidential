HDI analysis of candidates for Nigeria's presidential Election 2023

The 2023 Nigerian election🇳🇬 was one of the most competitive and contentious presidential races🏁 in the country’s history. 

The voters wanted change✊ and were ready to fight for it. 

The race came down to three main contenders, who represented different visions for the future: the new🆕 vs the old👴. 

The choice was between embracing change (for better or worse) or sticking with the familiar devil😈. 

Now, seven months after the ballots were cast and two months after the president’s inauguration🎉, the question remains: did the voters make the right choice❓ 

We conducted an in-depth analysis🔎 of the performance of two candidates(Peter Obi, Bola Ahmed Tinubu) as governors of their respective states.
We examined key indicators of economic progress💰 (income💵, health🏥, and education🎓) and the well-being of their citizens. 

Our analysis is not meant to judge who would have been a better president, but to provide some context and insights into the effects of their leadership and policies. 


Was there more substance behind the noise🗣️
